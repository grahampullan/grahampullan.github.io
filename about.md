Hello! I am Professor of Computational Aerothermal Design at the [Whittle Laboratory](https://whittle.eng.cam.ac.uk) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). Part of my [research](https://whittle.eng.cam.ac.uk/lab/team/graham-pullan) is on **interactive visualisation** of data from simulations or experiments, particularly [large ensembles](https://www.dbslice.org) of cases. It's not always easy to show these techniques using the static medium of a paper, so I'm hoping this blog can fill this gap!
